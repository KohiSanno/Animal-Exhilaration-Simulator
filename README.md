**Project Name: Animal Exhilaration Simulator (C#, File I/O, OOP)**

**Overview:**

In the Animal Exhilaration Simulator, a C#-based application, players monitor and influence the well-being of various hobby animals under the care of Cathy, whose mood swings determine the animals' exhilaration levels. This simulator, rooted in object-oriented programming principles, processes animal data through file I/O, tracking the fluctuating exhilaration levels of fishes, birds, and dogs in response to Cathy's changing moods. The program culminates by identifying the animal(s) with the lowest exhilaration level that survives after a series of simulations.

**Features:**

- Realistic simulation of animal well-being based on caretaker mood variations.
- Object-oriented architecture to efficiently manage animal entities and mood dynamics.
- Comprehensive file I/O for initializing animal profiles and daily mood fluctuations from a text file.
- Detailed algorithms to adjust exhilaration levels for each animal type according to daily mood changes.
- Capability to pinpoint and list the surviving animal(s) with the minimum exhilaration level at the simulation's end.

**Technical Highlights:**

- Proficient use of C# for encapsulating animal behaviors and caretaker mood effects within a robust OOP framework.
- Implementation of inheritance and interfaces to model diverse animal types and their unique responses to caretaker moods.
- Advanced file handling techniques in C# to parse simulation input data and manage simulation outcomes effectively.
- Strategic application of loops and conditional logic to model the simulation's daily operations and determine animal well-being.
- Efficient algorithm to identify and display the lowest exhilaration level survivors, demonstrating adeptness in data analysis and algorithmic problem-solving.
